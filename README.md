### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I should do more open source projects.

### What am I up to?
 - Exploring [uxn/tal](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/uxntal.html)
 - Learning `vim`
 - Pondering whether I should host my website on a real computer instead of on AWS
 - Finishing up a `python` based air-quailty monitoring system with my Dad

## BTW [I use Arch](https://github.com/brandonwkipp/btw-i-use-arch)

### Good evening Netizen ðŸ‘‹
My name is Brandon. How can I help you?

### What am I up to?
- Working on a VST3 plugin
- Exploring the state of audio on Linux
- Using `vim` quite a lot
- Learning `rust` because some yahoo wants to add telemetry into the `go` toolchain
